# DiPOSH documentation

DiPOSH is an evolution from POSH: Paris OpenSHMEM. POSH was designed to run on a single node over shared memory, DiPOSH is a distributed version; hence Distributed POSH.

DiPOSH is written in C++, trying to take advantage of an object-oriented architecture for composability and of templates.
